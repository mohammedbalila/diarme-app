An application to take notes. My main motivation to make this is to unify where my notes are. I use Android and every Android provider has their own notes app (Samsung notes, Huawei notes, etc...).
So every time I switch my phone I either lose my notes or have to go through a very manual process to move them, also all of these providers don't have a web interface.
With all that in mind I created this app. I'm planning to create another web version using Next.JS since Flutter web is still not ready

# Features:
    - Cross platform (web, mobile, desktop)
    - One account for all your notes across all devices
    - View & edit your notes offline & online

# Contributions:
    All PRs are welcome, I'm not a Flutter or mobile dev so I probably made a lot of mistakes
    in this app. I'm planning a refactor when I have time.
